# Do you need to borrow money?

Before you sign up for a credit card, bank loan or store card, or add to
an existing card or loan it makes sense to think about whether you
really need to borrow money.  At times like this &mdash; with economic
uncertainty and rising bills &mdash; many people are now choosing to pay back
money they've already borrowed rather than borrow more.

## Deciding whether you should be borrowing money

There are some very important questions you need to answer before you
borrow money. You should ask yourself if you need to spend the money, if
you have other ways of financing the purchase and if you can afford to
pay back the money you're planning to borrow.

### Do you really need to spend the money at all?

Some people who borrow money do so either without thinking if they can
really afford it, because credit is offered at the point of purchase
(for example store cards); or because they feel they have no other
option, but that often isn't the case. It may be that you could put off
making the purchase or not make it at all. Try asking yourself:

-   Could I wait until I can afford to buy the item without borrowing?
-   If there's something I need, is there another way of getting it (for
    example, swapping it for something else, buying it second-hand or
    getting it for free from a free recycling website)?

### Can you save up or use some savings instead of borrowing money?

If you really don't need to spend the money today, then you should
seriously consider saving some money each month rather than getting into
debt.

If you can wait and save up for a purchase, instead of using credit, it
will cost you far less (unless you qualify for a 0% credit card deal),
as you won't have to pay any interest. It might also have been reduced
in a sale or if it's technology, upgraded to a better model.

For example, if you wanted to buy something that cost &pound;600:

If you don't have any savings, but can save, for example, &pound;50 a month,
it would take you a year to save the &pound;600 and you would have earned &pound;6
in interest (assuming you're a basic rate taxpayer - which means 20% tax
comes off the interest you earn - and that you put the money into an
account paying 3% in interest).
