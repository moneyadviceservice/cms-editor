- Getting medical care on holiday could cost you thousands of pounds.
- Other insurance – like credit card accident cover and private health insurance – doesn’t cover most travel emergencies.
- Without insurance, you’ll have to cover emergency expenses on your own – the British Consulate can’t help you.
- Travel insurance that covers getting you home and medical expenses is essential.

Most policies include cover for:

- emergency medical expenses
- personal liability, in case you’re sued for damaging property or causing injury
- lost or stolen bags
- the costs of cancelling, delaying or cutting short your trip

## What isn’t covered by travel insurance?

There are some common things you should watch out for:

- If you are over 65 or have a medical condition, you might need specialist insurance. If you have a medical condition you have to tell your insurer, even if they don’t specifically ask you. When you buy insurance you must answer all questions about your circumstances and health honestly, and include everything, even if you think it’s not important, for example taking regular tablets for high blood pressure or angina  – if you don't your policy won't be valid.
- Adventure sports, winter sports and any ‘dangerous activities’ may need extra cover.
- With most policies, you aren’t covered for travel to countries or regions that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office recommends avoiding – [view the latest list on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website](http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country?action=noTravelAll#noTravelAll "Countries or regions the Foreign and Commonwealth Office recommends avoiding")
- Coverage for strikes, civil unrest, volcanic ash clouds, earthquakes, acts of terrorism and epidemics such as SARS varies.

Because travel insurance policies vary, we’ve prepared some guides to help you find the specific information – and cover – you need.

## Do you still need travel insurance if you have a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)?

- With an EHIC (formerly E111) you get the same level of state-provided medical care as someone who lives in the country you’re visiting. It’s valid in all European Economic Area countries and Switzerland.
- The downside is that the local level of care may not be the same as what you’d get in the UK. You will also need to pay for part of your bills, if that’s how the local system works.
- EHIC won’t cover the costs of repatriation – getting you back home – after a medical emergency on holiday, and this will be very costly.
- If you use an EHIC to get medical care, most insurers won’t ask you to pay the excess on your medical claims.
- While it’s worth getting an EHIC, it’s not enough on its own. You should still get travel insurance that includes medical and repatriation cover.

## Is travel insurance good value?

### Did you know?

The main benefit of travel insurance is in having emergency medical cover on holiday.

- What happens if you have a bad fall on the ski slopes and need a helicopter to a good hospital?
- How would you cope if one of the kids fell ill – even with something minor – in the US or another country with sky-high medical costs?

With those costs covered, you’ll quickly realise the value of having a holiday insurance policy.

The cover you get for personal possessions can be covered under your home contents insurance policy and so it’s best to check whether you have this already before you add it to your travel policy. Some travel insurers will give you a discount if you exclude baggage cover.
